Agent spies on cancer genes, predicts best treatments in virtual trials for personalized breast cancer survival
ABSTRACT
Breast cancer survival is hard to predict because of the complex ways genes and cells interact. This study offers a new method to improve these predictions by combining gene expression profiling (GEP) with agent-based modeling (ABM). First, GEP will pinpoint genes important in breast cancer development.  Then, a mathematical model will be built to show how these genes influence cell behavior.  This data will be used in an ABM to simulate tumor growth and treatment response.  The ABM allows us to virtually test different treatments and see how they might affect patient survival. Finally, the model's accuracy will be checked against real patient data and compared to other models.  By combining the strengths of GEP and ABM, this research could significantly improve breast cancer survival prediction.  The ABM's ability to analyze interactions mathematically could pave the way for more personalized and effective treatments.
